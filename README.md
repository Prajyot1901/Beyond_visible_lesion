#To test the results given in the manuscript, Follow the instructions.

1) Download the codes and model weights provided from the link: https://zenodo.org/records/18729677
2) Download the training data from the link. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation
3) Run both the code fles Slice_tumor.py and Slice_non_tumor.py for all three modalities seperately after changing the paths in the codes to the original paths of T1, T2 and FLAIR one at a time.
4) Now, run the remaining .py files after changing the paths to the original paths to get the final results. Here, note that you have to change paths to the saved model weights as well.
